# CHO Pixel Code

## Introductions

Hi, C₂₉H₂₅N₃O₅ here. Yes, it is me, the one who is making Touhou Arranges on Bilibili. In fact, I have been thinking for designing my own font for a very long time, long before I even knew about Touhou; but this was not realised due to hardware limitation. 

But I have to say, I am not a professional font designer, so the stuff I created certainly cannot be compared with the dedicated fonts designed by the experienced. This is merely an attempt for me to peek into the world of font design.

Anyway, this font is a monospaced, pixel font with only one weight and no italics (because it is easier to design, although I may add the variants later). Like Jetbrains Mono and Fira Code, I also introduced monospaced ligatures (such as != and www) to reduce the distraction when reading the codes. This font is can be used for programming and terminals, so I also added Powerline glyphs so this font can be used for certain shells and terminal emulators (such as Zsh and iTerm2). This font includes most Latin letters,  Cyrillic, and basic Greek letters, and supports about 160 different languages.

This work is also under a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 Licence. You can use it for nearly any purpose, e.g. advertising, designing, publishing, develop your new font based on this font, but you have to attribute to the original author (i.e. C₂₉H₂₅N₃O₅). You do not need to notify me when using this font.

I may not do further upgrades on this typeface after the initial release.

P.S. All the ligatures are included in the clig (contextual ligatures) feature. You can turn it off using macOS’s Font Panel (Use Command-T to open in certain apps) > (…) > Typography > Ligatures > Contextual Ligatures.



## Features

* Supports 170+ languages
* Supports 120+ monospaced ligatures (e.g. `-->`  and  `!=` )
* Optimisation of the letter ‘x’ in hexadecimal numbers (e.g. `0xEF`)
