# CHO Pixel Code

## Introductions

My first pixel-monospaced font! Inspired by Fira Code and Jetbrains Mono.

P.S. All the ligatures are included in the clig (contextual ligatures) feature. You can turn it off using macOS’s Font Panel (Use Command-T to open in certain apps) > (…) > Typography > Ligatures > Contextual Ligatures.



## Features

* Supports 170+ languages
* Supports 120+ monospaced ligatures (e.g. `-->`  and  `!=` )
* Optimization of the letter ‘x’ in hexadecimal numbers (e.g. `0xEF`)
* Support for Japanese kana
* Support for OpenType Features and alternative stylistic sets
* Hinting
