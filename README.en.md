   # CHO Pixel Code

   

   ## Introductions

   Hi, C₂₉H₂₅N₃O₅ here. Yes, it is me, the one who is making Touhou Arranges on Bilibili. Surprised?

   

   In fact, I have been thinking for designing my own font for a very long time, long before I even knew about Touhou; but this was not realised due to hardware limitation. But this year, I bought a MacBook and download Glyphs, so I can finally sit down and fulfil that dream. 

   

   But I have to say, I am not a professional font designer, so the stuff I created certainly cannot be compared with the dedicated fonts designed by the experienced. This is merely an attempt for me to peek into the world of font design.

   

   Anyway, this font is a monospaced, pixel font with only one weight and no italics (because it is easier to design, although I may add the variants later). Like Jetbrains Mono and Fira Code, I also introduced monospaced ligatures (such as != and www) to reduce the distraction when reading the codes. This font is can be used for programming and terminals, so I also added Powerline glyphs so this font can be used for certain shells and terminal emulators (such as Zsh and iTerm2). This font includes most Latin letters,  Cyrillic, and basic Greek letters, and supports about 160 different languages.

   

   This work is also under a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 Licence. You can use it for nearly any purpose, e.g. advertising, designing, publishing, develop your new font based on this font, but you have to attribute to the original author (i.e. C₂₉H₂₅N₃O₅). You do not need to notify me when using this font.

   

   P.S. All the ligatures are included in the clig (contextual ligatures). You can turn it off using macOS’s Font Panel > … > Typography > Ligatures > Contextual Ligatures.

   

   

   ## Features

   * Supports more than 170 languages
   * Supports more then 120 monospaced libraries (e.g. `-->`  and  `!=` )
   * Optimisation of the letter ‘x’ in hexadecimal numbers

   Please notice that http, https, ftp, and hexadecimal X ligatures may not show up as expected in certain text editors and terminal emulators.  Some text editors does not support ligatures. 

   

   

   ## Builds

   The compiled font is offered in 4 formats: TTF, OTF, WOFF, and WOFF2.

   

   However, if you want to build from source, you should follow this steps:

   

   1. **Make sure that your computer is running macOS.** Glyphs is only available on macOS. 
   2. Download the latest version of Glyphs at glyphsapp.com (you can choose to download the trail version as well). 
   3. Install Glyphs on your computer. 
   4. Open the .glyphs file using Glyphs. 
   5. Press Command-E on your keyboard and select your options. 
   6. Click “Export” to export the font file(s). 

   

   If you only have computer(s) running Windows, Linux or other OSs, consider using a virtual machine.
